My name is so long and so not designed for some countries that I am not going to trouble anyone in trying to spell it. I like to be called Gaby and I currently live in the US, in San Jose, CA.

I am a software engineer right now focused on front end development, though some years ago I was part of several backend teams and even for a small project I played as project manager.

I've been working with JavaScript, TypeScript and Angular for the last years.

I really believe that people can maintain a healthy brain by learning new things, so every now and then I come up with an absolutely-not-coding-related project.

I do love traveling and food, specially if they come together. I really hope some day I can host my own small hotel with a terrific restaurant and a mezcaler√≠a... Ideally in a small beach in the middle of nowhere, in Mexico.
