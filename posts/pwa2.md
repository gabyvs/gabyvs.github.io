Writing a Progressive Web App from scratch (Part 2)
===================================================

This is the second post on the series of writing a PWA from scratch. The first post on the series is [here](https://gabyvs.github.io/posts/pwa1.md)

## The Research

Today I started doing some research about PWAs. I really don't want to repeat what is out there already, but I do want to have some sources here so I can come back
to them once I forgot where I read all those interesting things :)

I used these main sources

* A page on PWAs written by Google on their [developers page](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/)
* This cool [article](http://blog.ionic.io/what-is-a-progressive-web-app/) by Ionic about what is a PWA
* A little outdated but very interesting [article](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/12/getting-started-pwa) written by Addy Osmani on how to get started with PWAs
* And finally a [sampler](https://pwa.rocks/) of some very cool PWAs 

Once I had read them, I started with the design of my very own PWA.
